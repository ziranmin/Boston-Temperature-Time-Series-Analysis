# Boston-Temperature-Time-Series-Analysis
The goal of this project is to fit Boston weekly temperature data into Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series models and make prediction. The Boston daily maximum temperature data from 2008 to 2018 are collected from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website, and the weekly temperature is computed by averaging every 7 days of daily observations. Through procedures of data transformation, model selection, model diagnostics, and forecasting, I find that SARIMA (1, 0, 1) âˆ— (0, 1, 1) 52 is the model with lowest AICc, but more comprehensive criteria are needed for selecting model that can forecast better.
